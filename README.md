## Description
 This app is a simple recipe search which explains how to use external api in a react app and fetch data and update state

## API

  I have used here an external API from Edamam for recipe search, to use the same goto https://www.edamam.com/ and create an account. There you can get an API Key and API ID. Create a file auth.json and and store the values there.

  Ex:

    {
      "api_key" : "your api key here",
      "api_id" : "your api id here"
    }

## Available Scripts

To run the app:

### `yarn start`
